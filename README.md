# Click-A-Dream
project for hackathon

For this project...the waterfall model of SDLC(software development lifecycle) is implemented which is breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.

So far,
The first step - Requirement specification is done.
The second step -UI/UX design process is taking place at the moment

hence, the source code will be posted as soon as the UI/UX design is completed
